# RMUL-Prototype-Documents
This contains all my work on the electrical network of the RMUL prototype for Legacy Robotics

This branch inludes power consumption calculations, network diagrams and BOM for the Electrical department at Legacy. 

See "Prototype network V2.png" for a diagram of the prototypes network. 
See "BOM" for a bill of manufacture on all the componenets purchased for the development of the network. 
See "Power Calculations" to see the relevant power consumption of the compoenents in the network of the bot.
